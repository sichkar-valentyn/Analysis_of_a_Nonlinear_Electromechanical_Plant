## Description
Each parameter M_L, dU, Kvf, and Mdf was adjusted separately, and, by doing this, the effect of each parameter on the system can be shown.
<br/>Implementing a step input and a sinusoidal input, a non-linear system with DC motor shows the following changes in response as the parameters M_L, dU, Kvf, and Mdf are adjusted independently. However, there may be additional interactions between these parameters, which is not explored.
<ul>
<li>As the parameter M_L is increased, the overall achievable range of angular velocities drastically decreased. The same velocity also requires a drastically higher amperage.</li>
<li>As the parameter dU is increased, the overall achievable range of angular velocities significantly decreased. The achieved velocity occurs at lower amperage.</li>
<li>As the parameter Kvf is increased, the overall achievable range of angular velocities decreased. The descriptive curves however nearly overlap.</li>
<li>As the parameter Mdf is increased, the overall achievable range of angular velocities slightly decreased.</li>
</ul>
